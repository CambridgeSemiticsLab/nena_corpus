This is the

app for the
[Northeastern Neo-Aramaic Corpus](https://github.com/CambridgeSemiticsLab/nena_corpus).

There is also a bunch of search interfaces for the NENA corpus.
It is online, but it works on your computer, in the browser.

Just click
[nena-search](https://annotation.github.io/app-nena/)
and off you go.
