  /* THE STATE
   *
   * The state contains changeable information needed to present the
   * interface.
   * It contains two kinds of information:
   *   - computed search results
   *   - user interaction state (button clicks, field entries)
   *
   * For a description of the state members, see the class definition below.
   *
   * MUTABLE STATE
   *
   * Contrary React-Redux practice, our state is mutable.
   * We do not work with cycles that re-render the display after state changes,
   * so we do not need to detect state changes efficiently.
   * Instead, at each state change, we also update the interface.
   *
   * STATE PROVIDER OBJECT
   *
   * The state logic is encapsulated in a class which is instantiated
   * with one object, whose data represents the state of the app.
   *
   * INITIAL STATE
   *
   * The jobState part of the data is fixed in shape.
   * The State Provider furnish a jobState that has all members and sub members present,
   * filled with default values, none of which are undefined
   * (null is allowed for leaf members)
   *
   * The jobState can be initialized from external, incoming data,
   * use the startj method for that.
   *
   * SAFE MERGE
   *
   * The jobState may come from untrusted sources, such as an imported file
   * of localStorage. Such a jobState may not conform to the shape of the jobState
   * as prescribed here.
   * So the Provider performs a safe merge of the new jobState into a
   * fresh initial jobState.
   * A safe merge copies leaf members of the incoming state into corresponding places
   * in the initial state, provided the path in the incoming state exists in the initial
   * state, and the type of the value in the incoming state is the same as that of
   * the corresponding value in the initial state,
   * and the incoming value is not undefined.
   * If the type of the value is string, the value should be less than MAXINPUT.
   *
   * If any of these conditions are not met, the update of that value is skipped.
   * An error message will be written to the console .
   *
   * GETTING the state
   *
   * Always by the gets() or getj() methods
   *
   * gets is for top level state slices except jobState
   * sets gets the jobState slice as a deep copy (so you cannot modify the jobState)
   *
   * const { query: { [nType]: { [layer]: pattern } } } = State.getj()
   *
   * N.B. We do not have to take care to use default values ( = {} ) for intermediate
   * subobjects, because the members of the jobState are guaranteed to exist.
   *
   * SETTING the state
   *
   * Always by the sets() or setj() methods
   *
   * We get the members of state object back (except jobState).
   * This enables patterns where we set a state member
   * and then use that value in a local variable:
   *
   * const { tpResults } = State.sets({ tpResults: {} })
   *
   * Note that setj() does not return data!
   *
   * When setting the jobState with setj(),
   * we apply the same checks as when we start a job from external data.
   *
   * INVARIANT:
   *
   * The jobState always has the full prescribed shape, with all members present at any
   * level, and with no undefined leaf values
