/* --- INTRO ----------------------------------------------
 *
 * This is a Web App that implements Layered Search in a Corpus.
 * The app is a single page app (SPA), meant to work with a static HTML file,
 * not served by a webserver, not even by localhost, although both should be possible.

/* --- OVERVIEW ----------------------------------------------
 *
 * The code consists of 10 classes, divided into 3 groups.
 *
 * N.B: I would have liked to separate the classes into files and then
 * use the import mechanism to include them.
 * However, that will work only when the app is served by a server (web or localhost),
 * but not when it is a local file, opened in the browser.
 * See:
 *
 * The 10 classes define Service Providers.
 * They will each be instantiated by single object the Provider.
 *
 * We list them in the order that they are defined in the code.
 *
 * Functional   Business logic
 * ---------------------------
 * Config       Manages incoming config data of the corpus
 * Corpus       Manages incoming bulk data of the corpus
 * Search       Implements the search algorithm
 *
 * Application  Generic logic of a typical webapp
 * ----------------------------------------------
 * State        Single source of truth about computations and user interactions
 * Job          Task units that can be saved and loaded, imported and exported
 * Gui          The graphical user interface
 *
 * Systems      Low level technical provisions
 * -------------------------------------------
 * Disk         Uploading and donwloading files
 * Mem          Storing data in Local Storage
 * Log          Feedback to the user
 *
 * Top-level    Making it work
 * ---------------------------
 * App          Orchestrates the service providers
 */

/* --- PATTERNS ----------------------------------------------
 *
 * The service providers (except top-level App) share a common pattern:
 * they start life like this:
 *
 *    constructor() do nothing
 *    deps()        create a links to all other providers that this provider needs
 *    init()        actions that can be done quickly and immediately
 *    later()       actions that can be done once all data has been loaded
 *
 * The rest is business logic and auxilary functions
 *
 * The GuiProvider has the following pattern
 *
 *    init()        build: generate HTML,
 *                  activate: furnish buttons and text inputs with event listeners
 *    apply()       when the state has changed, update the interface to reflect
 *                  the latest changes
 *
 * Importantly, apply-like functions may not be executed during "init" time,
 * only at "later" time.
 */

/* --- CORPUS DATA ----------------------------------------------
 *
 * The fixed data is in the global vars corpusxxx and configData.
 *
 * Both kinds of data will be wrapped into Provider objects: Config and Corpus
 * after which the global vars should not be accessed, not even for reading.
 * We cannot really enforce this, though.
 *
 * Config is for the small configuration data.
 *
 * Corpus contains the big textual and positional data.
 */

/* --- BUSINESS LOGIC ----------------------------------------------
 *
 * In this app, the logic is: layered search.
 *
 * See:
 * (https://annotation.github.io/text-fabric/tf/about/clientmanual.html)

/* TOP LEVEL ORCHESTRATION
 *
 * We take care to use an async function for the longish
 * initialization, so that we can display progress messages
 * in the mean time
 *
 * Feature testing
 * We test some features for support in the current browser, and register the outcome
 * for further use in the app.
 *
 * Document loading:
 * we take care that the user sees as much of the interface as early as possible.
 * We specifiy all scripts in the header of the document, but with the defer
 * attribute, so that the scripts load asynchronously
 * and are executed in the given order:
 *
 * configdata.js
 *  - information on the basis of which this app builds the interface
 *  - small file
 * layered.js
 *  - the app itself (this very script that you are reading now)
 * corpusdata.js
 *  - texts and mappings from nodes to textual positions
 *  - a big file, multi-megabyte
 *
 * When the document is ready, and the app has been loaded, the app will execute
 * initInterface() which builds the interface.
 *
 * In the meanwhile, corpusdata is still being fetched, while the interface is
 * probably already rendered.
 * When corpusdata is in, the app will execute initCorpus().
 *
 * Then the app continues by fetching the most recent known job, if any,
 * and executes its query
 *
 * Only then the app is ready to use, and the progress/waiting markers disappear.
